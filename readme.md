## What I Learned
Working on this project helped me understand how to structure a professional portfolio website from scratch.  
I learned how to design responsive layouts using **Flexbox**, create visually appealing sections with proper alignment,  
and organize my HTML and CSS code cleanly for better readability and reusability.  
It also helped me improve my understanding of color combinations, spacing, and basic design aesthetics.
